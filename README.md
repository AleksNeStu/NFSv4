1. The brief overview of the project:
=====================================
Test cases for testing of NFS4 file system on Linux-like systems. 
Subject of testing: content, ACL (Access Control List) (permission, owner, ...) modification auto-testing of NFS4 file system. 

2. Project description:
=======================
The structure of the project:
- "./NFS4_v1.py" - the main file that run all of tests
- "./payload/" - the directory which contains a set of tests (each file is a separate test) *** can be supplemented
- "./result/" - the directory which contains the execution results (log-files in text form)
- "./NFS4_tests_info.pdf" - the full description of work with the project

The technology of the project:
- Linux-like systems (e.q. Fedora 23 x86-64, RHEL 7.1 x86-64)
- Python 2.7 interpreter with standart library
- IDE (Pycharm 2016.1, Sublime Text 3)
- Debugger (Winpdb)

3. Technical requirements
=========================
In order to run the tests: Linux-like system (preferably RedHat-base with support of NFS4), Python interpreter 2.x or 3.x (preferably v.2.7), internet-connection (for access to clone the project on the hub)

In order to view the full description file - any pdf viewer

CONCLUSION:
===========
Thank you all, I believe that Linux-solutions and Python are very useful technology for all people of all ages...
Enjoy and have a nice day:) 
See you soon!!!
